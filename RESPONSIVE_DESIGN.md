## Breakpoint Strategy

```css
/* Mobile First Approach */
sm: 640px   /* Small tablets */
md: 768px   /* Tablets */
lg: 1024px  /* Small desktops */
xl: 1280px  /* Large desktops */
2xl: 1536px /* Extra large screens */
```

## Animation Guidelines
- **Duration**: 150ms (fast), 300ms (normal), 500ms (slow)
- **Easing**: cubic-bezier for natural motion
- **Transforms**: Preferred over layout-affecting properties
- **Reduced motion**: Respects user preferences

## Accessibility Improvements
- **Focus indicators** with proper contrast
- **Touch targets** minimum 44px for mobile
- **Screen reader support** with proper ARIA labels
- **Keyboard navigation** for all interactive elements
- **Color contrast** meets WCAG guidelines

## Browser Support
- **Modern browsers** with CSS Grid support
- **Progressive enhancement** for older browsers
- **Fallbacks** for unsupported features
- **Tested on** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## Future Enhancements
- Dark mode toggle with system preference detection
- Advanced animation preferences
- More sophisticated loading states
- Enhanced gesture support for mobile
- Performance monitoring and optimization
